# Usability-Test

### Scenario 1: Unauthorized Access to University Email System

#### **Issue**  
A university’s IT department notices unusual login attempts on multiple faculty and staff email accounts. Some users report receiving emails that appear to be from the university administration, requesting them to log in through a provided link. Others have noticed that emails were sent from their accounts without their knowledge. The IT department suspects a phishing attack or compromised credentials, which could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive university information.

#### **User's Task (Prompt Objective)**  
Participants must craft a prompt that helps them:

1. Understand the nature of the security threat.  
2. Take immediate steps to mitigate the risk and prevent further compromise.  
3. Implement security measures to protect university email accounts in the future.

#### **Expected Outcome (LLM Response Goals)**  
An ideal LLM response should provide:

**• Identification of the Threat:**
- Explanation of phishing attacks targeting university emails.  
- How attackers use fake login pages or malware to steal credentials.  
- Potential risks (e.g., data leaks, identity theft, access to student records).  

**• Mitigation and Immediate Response:**
- Reset passwords for compromised accounts.  
- Notify all faculty and staff about the phishing attempt.  
- Block access from suspicious IPs or locations.  
- Conduct a security audit to check for further vulnerabilities.  

**• Preventive Measures for Future Protection:**
- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for university email logins.  
- Conduct cybersecurity awareness training for faculty and staff.  
- Implement email filtering to detect and block phishing attempts.  
- Encourage users to verify emails before clicking on links.

This scenario is relevant to university departments, emphasizing cybersecurity best practices while being understandable to non-technical staff and faculty.

### Scenario 2: Suspicious Bank Transaction

#### **Issue**  
A user receives a text message and an email alert from their bank about a transaction they don’t recognize. The message claims that a withdrawal of $500 was made from their account. The user checks their banking app and sees the charge, but they did not authorize it. They are unsure whether this is fraud, a mistake, or if their account has been compromised.

#### **User's Task (Prompt Objective)**  
Participants must craft a prompt that helps them:

1. Understand whether this transaction is fraudulent.  
2. Take immediate action to secure their bank account and funds.  
3. Prevent future unauthorized transactions.

#### **Expected Outcome (LLM Response Goals)**  
An ideal LLM response should provide:

**• Steps to Confirm if the Transaction is Fraudulent:**
- Check with family members or authorized users.  
- Review transaction details (merchant, location, time).  
- Contact the bank using an official number to verify.  

**• Immediate Actions to Take If It’s Fraud:**
- Report unauthorized transactions to the bank.  
- Lock or freeze the account if necessary.  
- Change online banking passwords.  
- Enable fraud alerts and notifications.  

**• Preventative Measures for Future Security:**
- Use strong, unique passwords for online banking.  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).  
- Regularly monitor account statements for suspicious activity.  
- Be cautious of phishing emails or scam calls posing as banks.  

This scenario is something a general audience can relate to, while still touching on key cybersecurity and fraud prevention concepts.

### Scenario 3: Social Media Account Compromise

#### **Issue**  
A user receives a notification that their social media account (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter) was accessed from an unfamiliar location. Shortly after, they are locked out of their account, and their friends start receiving suspicious messages or scam links from their profile. The user is unsure how their account was compromised and is worried about potential data theft or further security risks.

#### **User's Task (Prompt Objective)**  
Participants must craft a prompt that helps them:

1. Understand how the account might have been hacked.  
2. Recover and secure the compromised account.  
3. Prevent future unauthorized access.

#### **Expected Outcome (LLM Response Goals)**  
An ideal LLM response should provide:

**• Possible Causes of the Compromise:**
- Weak or reused passwords.  
- Clicking on phishing links.  
- Unauthorized third-party app access.  
- Malware or keyloggers.  

**• Recovery Steps:**
- Try logging in and using the "Forgot Password" option.  
- Contact the platform’s support team if locked out.  
- Remove any suspicious third-party apps.  
- Scan devices for malware.  

**• Security Best Practices for Prevention:**
- Use a strong, unique password.  
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- Be cautious of phishing links and scams.  
- Regularly review login activity and authorized apps.  

This scenario is approachable for non-technical users while still highlighting key cybersecurity principles.
